				<h4>Welcome to Sudoku Solver!</h4>
				<p>
					 I studied Sudoku in 2010 and since then it has become one of my favourite hobbies. Each time I solve a puzzle,
					my confidence levels were boosted up and I could identify typical patterns to solve the puzzles in various levels in optimal time.
				</p>
				<p>
					After a few years, I realized that my brain was sub-consciously implementing Backtracking algorithm in solving any Sudoku.
					I studied this pattern well and now implemented it in this app which can solve a partially filled grid.
					Give a try üòÅ and share your feedback with me at <a href="https://saiteja-malladi.web.app">Sai Teja Malladi</a>
